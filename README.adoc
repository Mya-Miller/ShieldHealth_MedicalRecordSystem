== Introduction
=== What is Shield Health?

Shield Health is a medical record system that allows doctors and hospital staff to manage their patients, appointments, and medication. Shield health ensures security through the implementation of the least privilege principle. This means users are granted access only to the resources and functionalities essential for their designated roles, which lowers the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.
